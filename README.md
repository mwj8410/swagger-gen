# swagger-gen
A module for generating swagger documentation from inline comments.

## Experiment Completed

### Conclusion

This method does function but ends up reducing the end functionality of the swagger system itself.

Specifically, there is no clear method for expressing global response modules. Although this is not a serious problem, it is a limiting factor that causes hesitation.

This module and method is therefore deemed inappropriately complex for delivering limited value.
